ShinobiCharts Pie Chart Labels (Objective-C)
=====================

This app builds on the PieChart demo shipped with ShinobiCharts, to fully customize the pie and donut chart labels and even move them out of the slices! There is an accompanying blog post [here](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/blog/posts/2012/08/06/pie-chart-labels-that-are-out-of-this-slice/).

*Note that as of* **shinobicharts** *v2.8.0, pie and donut chart spokes are part of the library, so there's no need for the extra work as shown in this sample. Spokes can now be enabled by setting `style.spokeStyle.showSpokes = YES` on the pie/donut seriesâ€™ style object.*

    

Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiCharts. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiCharts website](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/shinobicharts/).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiCharts, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiCharts, open up the project in Xcode, and drag ShinobiCharts.embeddedframework from the finder into Xcode's 'frameworks' group, and Xcode will sort out all the header and linker paths for you.

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up ViewController.m and edit the following line:

    //Enter your trial license key here
    NSString *licenseKey = @"";
